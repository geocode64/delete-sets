<h1>DELETE YOUR SETS</h1>

*Tidy up your list of Alma sets quickly with this bulk deletion tool.*

This Cloud App was developed as part of the ANZREG Cloud Apps Hackathon 2021. It was created to address the following problem which was raised in the Alma Idea Exchange:

> Often we work on a set of records and then the set is no longer
> needed and/or is empty. We have accumulated many of these and
> would like the ability to select multiple sets and delete these. This
> should be limited to sets the user owns - not other user's sets.
> (see [Idea Exchange](https://ideas.exlibrisgroup.com/forums/308173-alma/suggestions/33505454-add-the-ability-to-delete-multiple-sets-from-the))

<h2>How It Works</h2>

Select multiple sets from the **Admin** > **Manage Sets** > **My Sets** page within Alma for simultaneous removal (you may only select sets that were created by the Alma account you are logged in with).
