<h1>DELETE YOUR SETS</h1>

*Tidy up your list of Alma sets quickly with this bulk deletion tool.*

This Cloud App was developed as part of the ANZREG Cloud Apps Hackathon 2021. It was created to address the following problem which was raised in the Alma Idea Exchange:

> Often we work on a set of records and then the set is no longer
> needed and/or is empty. We have accumulated many of these and
> would like the ability to select multiple sets and delete these. This
> should be limited to sets the user owns - not other user's sets.
> (see [Idea Exchange](https://ideas.exlibrisgroup.com/forums/308173-alma/suggestions/33505454-add-the-ability-to-delete-multiple-sets-from-the))

<h2>How It Works</h2>

Select multiple sets from the **Admin** > **Manage Sets** > **My Sets** page within Alma for simultaneous removal (you may only delete sets that were created by the Alma account you are logged in with). While the app can be used on the **Public Sets** and **All Sets** tabs, the app will only display and allow the deletion of sets created by the logged in user account.

If you have a large number of sets, use the **Content Type** filter and the **Results per page** option on the **Manage Sets** page to refine the sets to those you want to work with.

The app will advise you of any Public sets selected as a precaution against deleting sets that may be in use by others. 

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

If you are on the **Manage Sets** page and no sets are displaying, check whether you need to remove or change any filters applied and that you are on the **My Sets** tab.
